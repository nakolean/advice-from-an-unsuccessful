_The more decisions that you are forced to make alone, the more you are aware of your freedom to choose. - Thornton Wilder
_

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I want to tell you something very simple and profound. When the sun rises, whether it be San Francisco, New York, in a penthouse,  or a trailer park, or somewhere in between, the man in the mirror brought you to this place. The man in the mirror is solely responsible for where you are today. 

Many people will object by pointing out the influence that circumstances have, but I tell you letting others or your environment dictate your life choices is twice as foolish. For not only do you suffer from the outcomes, but you fail  to learn as well. No one has ever blamed their way to a better future. Blame, or lack of responsibility, ensures a life at the mercy of the environment around you. 

If you still feel that I do not fully understand your peculiar and unique situation, you would be correct. It is true that you are one of a kind, for there is no one precisely like you. But many before you have fallen in love and felt the way you feel, or they’ve been as broke,as depressed, or as bored out of their mind as you. Every part of the human condition has been experienced many times over. **Your story is not one of kind; it’s original to you but far from original.**

The solution is simple, as it has been in all the stories before and after our time, no matter the variables involved. However, it’s not without its consequence. If the circumstance or the company you keep is the reason the man in the mirror does not smile back, walk away…...find a new mirror. 

“It’s more complicated than that.” is the common objection from any sensible person. 
 I would have sympathized with that statement...  but life has a way of teaching. 


The nature of my employment requires relocation across the country at a moment's notice, or a two year assignment at same location. This uncertainty brought me clarity pertaining to circumstances and change.


Thursday. I was in a office all alone. Seven weeks into my first job out of college. No one was in the cold quiet building but me (office of 4 with everyone traveling regularly). The phone rings. My boss calls, with an unexpected bombshell loaded. “John, I am going to send you to Connecticut. You will be reporting for work next Wednesday.” I asked how long will I be there, and he gave me a vague 3 to 6 months. I hung up the phone with a unique sensation. The last time I had this tingle was when the first offer of full employment was given to me almost a year earlier. This had the same weight but a sombering tone of obligation, not one of possibility. I slowly rolled back into my chair, bent down a bit, and blankly stared at the edge of my desk, millions of questions formulating with no answers in sight. The office was no longer cold or quiet. I had concerns that demanded answers. The perceived control I had over my life was a distant memory. My first thought……. why would the company move me halfway across the country for an unset amount of time? I am so new to the company and without even a full weeks notice. I knew I was going to travel, but I didn’t expect this. I will be away from family and friends in a place where I don’t know anyone. I don’t have a place to live. What am I going to do? My hands were not pale from cold office but a dark red from overwhelming stress. My palms were now sweaty…. I took a deep breath, rolled back further from the desk, leaned back, blankly staring at the generic office ceiling tiles. “I choose this.” I sat up and looked at my computer monitors. “I choose this.” After that, there were no more doubts. I prepared to move across the country.


I am an engineer by trade and spent my academic years in the books and not at the bars, as my time at university drew to a close and the search for employment began, I was presented with 6 official offers, and a few more offers would have materialize, but timelines did not coincide. I choose a traveling job instead of having my hours harvested in the cubicle farms of Corporate America. This decision made almost exactly a year before I got the call to Connecticut. Whether it was year in advance or only a day, it was my decision. “I choose this life to live.”


12 hours of driving later, I found myself in little town of Danbury, CT.  On that first night after work, I got home, and it finally sunk in that I could pack up my entire life and go anywhere. The question was not how or why, but why not? 


No circumstance is impossible if you are willing to make sacrifices. I do not say sacrifice is easy. I had many sleepless night until I choose the traveling job. I gave up five other different lives I could have lived. My mind wonders what could have been every time uncertainty comes knocking._** I think that we never really give testament to the burden of freedom. The simple idea of what to do with our time and talents and to be left to our own devices is a tough cross to bear.
