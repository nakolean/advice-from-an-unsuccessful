In some ways, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice- Viktor E. Frankl, 

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When we were barely old enough to reach the kitchen countertops we waited for spring break, summer vacation, and Christmas with unwavering anticipation. The time between these seasons seemed like an eternity from our mere perceptions of reality;. We were blessed beyond our imagination with clear, defined purpose that was involuntarily bestowed upon us by educational systems and parental authority. We study for the next spelling bee or practice jump shots for the next basketball game. We check off box after box as we walk through life from grade school to university.



I graduated university, just like my peers, and  had obtain every goal set out for me by the powers that be. I was faced with the question of “What is next for me?” with no tangible way to answer it. Because I had never answered that question by myself or for myself. 



What's the final goal of life?  Hell, let's not be greedy, what the next step in my life? My next raise is not going to be life changing, nor my next vacation, nor my home, nor car. In adolescence, we strive from pre-defined goal to pre-defined goal. Established by our parents or society to arrive at this point in life; the one where I find myself today: a white collar job at 22. ( It’s hard to call construction a white collar job, but I have engineering degree,  we can split the difference. ) I stand before you with no future boxes to check. The final bridge has been crossed into adulthood. The seasons of life that are now presented to me are farther and wider than I could ever image. Up until this point, I was given a standard to be put against, a scale to be graded upon. Now what's left….nothing. There is a sinking feeling to this. Not a feeling I would wish upon others. 



 The only item left is retirement. I have no desire to obsess  over a goal that will matierize 30 years from now.  Using this goal in my day to day life to build a foundation for a fulfilling life is folly. I do believe compound interest is the 8th greatest wonder in the world, and I do max out all of tax advantage retire programs, 401k and Roth IRA. Nevertheless, retirement is not a goal that I want to  occupy my thoughts on a day to day basis.



I never valued a clear sense of purpose until I didn’t have one. I come “home” after work to do what?  There is no longer tension between what has been done and what is still to be done. In what we are and in what we strive to become, preparing for the night gives purpose to day. When you arrive at a place where there is no night left, is it really paradise? Surely, I am still confronted with daily problems, but maturity has shown me that they are just minor inconveniences and should be treated as such.  In the modern world, we aren't born with an intended purpose. Arthur Schopenhauer articulated it perfectly, ‘ mankind may be doomed to vacillate eternally between the two extremes of distress and boredom.’ Survival, food, and running water are all at my disposal. True distress in first world countries is only written in history books. 

Bernard Suits Thesis article of “what is Game” articulates it very well. A game is at heart the creation of challenge against which one test oneself. A good game embodies a well crafted problem and it is in the owning and embracing of the problem that players are able to grow in what Greek Olympians call ‘arete’: excellence of will and character. 



I have come to realize that I don’t want an easy life, and I don’t think you want one either. People want things that are difficult, things that can be overcome, an optimal challenge.

**Suffering that was worth it, bearing of a worthwhile burden ** give meaning to the game of life. I cannot tell you what is worth suffering for or what a worthwhile burden is or where to find it. What I can say is if we wait around for others to bestow new purpose in our lives it will most likely be misguided, or it will never materialize, either way our greatest achievement will have only been our potential.
