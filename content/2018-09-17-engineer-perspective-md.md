“It is exciting to discover electrons and figure out the equations that govern their movement; it is boring to use those principles to design electric can openers. From here on out, it's all can openers.”

― Neal Stephenson

The text before you is written by an engineer (expect a few spelling mistakes). Engineering at its core is the application of science to the natural world. For at my core, I was educated to understand and apply. What frustrated me the most in my academic years was to waste 3 to 6 pages deriving an equation I already knew to be true. This blog will not be a elegant collage of symbolism and metaphors, but neither is life. Facts are cold and hard to swallow, but facts are facts. 

The 80/20  ( Pareto Principle)

In 1906, Economist Vilfredo Pareto noticed an unequal relationship between inputs and outputs. The principle states that 20% of the invested input is responsible for 80% of the results obtained.

This principle is found everywhere:

20% of my clothes are worn 80% of the time.

80% of your complaints come from 20% of your customers.

80% of wealth is owned by 20% of people.

20 % of the carpet receives 80% of the wear.

This blog is written with this in mind. I seek  the 20% in the core foundations of life and to put them in this blog. As a 23 year old just out of college working 6 or 7 days a week, I have no desire to waste my limited time or money on the expendable 80%.
