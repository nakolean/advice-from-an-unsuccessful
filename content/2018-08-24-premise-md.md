“There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.”

― Ernest Hemingway

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you found your way to this blog, you are seeking a better way to live. Ironically, I wrote it for that exact same reason. 

In the West, more than 90% of people will marry, yet 40 to 50 % end in divorce.

78% of workers said they live paycheck to paycheck. 

51% aren’t engaged with their daily work, meaning they feel no real connection to their jobs, and thus they tend to do the bare minimum.

It appears that we are not living the lives we want to live, and self help books are better at  separating us from our money to the tune of 11 billion dollars a year than aiding us in the journey to a fulfilling and meaningful life. 

If you want a flowery self help, power of positive thinking, pat on the back literature, there are other website for you; looking for a guy or girl in a suit and bright smile on the Barnes in Noble shelf will also suffice. I guarantee their metaphors and stories are more eloquent and creative than anything I could come up with. 

I know that having an unsuccessful 23 year old write a self help blog is peculiar. Consider that literature of this nature has always been written as reflections  with a God-like perspective. The ability to see all the rights and all of the wrong as a distant past on the journey to success. Although insightful, this aloof perspective is not our real experiences. I do not give advice by looking back reminiscing on what was but looking forward on what could be.

 As these posts of this blog are typed, I do not have a gold medal, Nobel Prize, a best selling book, a million dollars, a PhD, or any other claim to authority. 

I believe that this perspective makes all the difference.
